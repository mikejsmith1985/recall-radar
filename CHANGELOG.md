### Added
- Forge Workflow initialised: constitution, git hooks, Spec Kit pipeline carried over
  from the Randomness project so the same rules bind here from the first commit.

  Api projects, xUnit unit and integration test projects, a pgvector Postgres compose
  file, and a dev-run script that stops processes only by recorded PID (Article II).
